This paper examines the numerical design, simulation, construction and testing of a rectangular to cylindrical waveguide mode converter. Using slots machined along the length of the cylindrical section, mode conversion can be forced from the TE<sub>1,0</sub> rectangular mode to the TE<sub>2,1</sub> cylindrical mode. This allowed for  subsequent mode conversion to a TE<sub>2,2</sub> mode, which was the operating mode of a gyro-multiplier, and is detailed in a future paper.
