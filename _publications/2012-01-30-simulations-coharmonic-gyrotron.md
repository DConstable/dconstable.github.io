This paper details the numerical simulation of a co-harmonic gyrotron, driven at the 2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic, and producing coherent radiation at the 4<sup>th</sup> harmonic. The 2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic signal was intended to be confined by an output taper to a below cut-off section of waveguide; however, our simulations show the signal undergoes mode conversion, which dominates the output spectra. By increasing the length of the taper, an improved confinement of the driving signal is predicted.
