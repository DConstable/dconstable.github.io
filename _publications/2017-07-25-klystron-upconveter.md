This paper examines two klystron designs, operating in the W-band where the output cavities operate in higher order modes, allowing a third harmonic signal to be extracted. A six cavity design is predicted to have an output power of ~90 W, at a frequency of 105 GHz. A three cavity design is manufactured usingg 3-D printing, allowing microwave measurements to be performed.
